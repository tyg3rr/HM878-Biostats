    "4. Extraction:\n",
    "    - *Method* dropdown box: Choose Principal axis factoring (teachable moment. This is for running a factor analysis; the reason for this method is that we believe the factors we will identify are correlated AND it can be used to measure latent factors. Latent factors are basically things we can’t measure directly with a single question/variable such as a broad concept like intelligence, or job satisfaction, etc.)\n",
    "    - Click *Scree plot*\n",
    "    - Leave everything else the way it is, click *Continue*\n",
    "5. Rotation: Click on *Direct Oblimin* (another teachable moment. Why Direct Oblimin? This is explained in one of the videos and the textbook reading). Make sure *Rotated Solution* and *Loading plots* are both checked. Click *Continue*\n",
    "6. Options: *Exclude cases listwise* should already be checked. Check *Sorted by size* and *Suppress small coefficients*. Enter 0.30 in the *Absolute value below* box. Click *Continue*\n",
    "7. Once you have specified the conditions to run the analysis, Click *OK*.\n",
    "8. For now, scroll to the end of the output and double click on the Factor Plot. A window with the plot will pop up. On the second menu bar row is an icon that allows you to rotate the 3-D chart. Click on the icon. A smaller box will open. Enter 60 in the vertical box, and 45 in the horizontal box. Notice how the perspective of the plot changes. Close out the pop-up window by clicking the “X” in the top right corner.\n"
