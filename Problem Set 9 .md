## Project #6: Factor Analysis

Lillian Jensen

**Goal**

Students will use SPSS to conduct and interpret a Factor Analysis

**Note**

We are using data from a new dataset for this analysis. Right now, I am not identifying the data source or the names of the variables, questions, or coding. Here’s the reason: Many times statisticians are blinded to the purpose of the study for which they are analyzing
data. Most of the time, being blinded doesn’t matter. But sometimes, when interpreting results, knowing what they variables are and knowing what the research question is can bias the researchers. So, in this case, I’ve given you a scrubbed dataset. All you have is numbers. Remember, with factor analysis, the
investigator has to interpret the data and determine what the variables are representing for each factor that is identified.

There are two parts of instructions/materials for this project. The first part has you actually running the analysis and interpreting the results. The second part provides you with much more information about the variables and asks you to interpret the data in more detail. Please stop when you reach this warning and
complete Part 1 before moving on

Obviously, this is on the honor system, but you will get much more out of this if you don’t skip ahead to see the rest of the information.
Note: I highly encourage you to watch the “Lecture” and “Analysis Demonstration” videos on D2L BEFORE doing this project. There are different ways of doing this and each has value. The instructions below show you how I want you to do it for this project.

**Part 1 Instructions**

1. Open the dataset in SPSS, Click on Analyze -> Dimension Reduction -> Factor
2. Move all of the variables to the “Variables” box, EXCEPT for the variable called “ID”
3. Descriptives: Keep “Initial Solution” clicked on. Click on “Coefficients” and “KMO and Bartlett’s test of sphericity.” Click “Continue.”
4. Extraction:
    - “Method” dropdown box: Choose Principal axis factoring (teachable moment) – this is for running a factor analysis – the reason for this method is that we believe the factors we will identify are correlated AND it can be used to measure latent factors. Latent factors are basically things we can’t measure directly with a single question/variable such as a broad concept like intelligence, or job satisfaction, etc.
    - Click “Scree plot”
    - Leave everything else the way it is, click “Continue”
5. Rotation: Click on “Direct Oblimin” (another teachable moment - why Direct Oblimin? – this is
explained in one of the videos and the textbook reading). Make sure “Rotated Solution” and
“Loading plots” are both checked. Click “Continue.”
6. Options: “Exclude cases listwise” should already be checked. Check “Sorted by size” and “Suppress small coefficients.” Enter 0.30 in the “Absolute value below” box. Click “Continue.”
7. Once you have specified the conditions to run the analysis, Click “OK.”
8. For now, scroll to the end of the output and double click on the Factor Plot. A window with the plot will pop up. On the second menu bar row is an icon that allows you to rotate the 3-D chart. Click on the icon. A smaller box will open. Enter 60 in the vertical box, and 45 in the horizontal box. Notice how the perspective of the plot changes. Close out the pop-up window by clicking the “X” in the top right corner.


**Questions**

1. List the Approx. chi-square, degrees of freedom, and significance value of the Bartlett’s Test of
Sphericity. What does this test tell us?
ANSWER HERE:
2. What does the KMO Measure of Sampling adequacy tell us?
ANSWER HERE:
3. Review the “Total Variance Explained” table and the “Scree Plot.”
    - How many factors are identified by the table (include eigenvalues for each factor) and the
plot?
ANSWER HERE:
    - Could the table and plot be interpreted differently? Explain.
ANSWER HERE:
    - How much variance in the data is explained by the identified factors?
ANSWER HERE:
4. Compare the “Structure Matrix” table with the “Factor Plot in Rotated Factor Space” plot.
    - List each Factor by number and list the corresponding variables that load on each factor.
ANSWER HERE:
    - Do the table and plot provide similar results? Explain.

**Part 2 Instructions**

The data set for this project was obtained from the [General Social Survey](https://www.norc.org/Research/Projects/Pages/general-social-survey.aspx) (GSS). According to the GSS website, “The GSS aims to gather data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes; to examine the structure and functioning of society in general as well as the role played by relevant subgroups; to compare the United States to other societies in order to place American society in comparative perspective and develop cross-national models of human society; and to make high-quality data easily accessible to scholars, students, policy makers, and others, with minimal cost and waiting.”

The text of each question of the survey used for this project, as well as the coding, is included in the codebook.  Using this information, answer the following:

5.	Review which variables are included in each factor.  Considering the questions that are aligned with each variable, and how each variable loads on a factor, provide a description of the latent measure that each factor might represent.  In other words, based on the first part of the project, you should have identified 3 factors; what do these factors measure (theoretically)?  In thinking about this data and these questions, why might it be important that statisticians and investigators be blinded to survey items?
ANSWER HERE: 
6.	Review the “Factors Correlation Matrix” table of your analysis output.  Remember that these represent how each factor correlates with the other.  Based on how each variable is coded (see below) and how each variable loads on to a factor, interpret these correlations; do they make sense?  Explain.
