# HM878-Biostats
Coursework for HM 878 Applied Biostatistics for Public Health Practitioners

The focus of this course is on applied biostatistical techniques but builds upon theoretical concepts from introductory biostatistics courses. As such, we will focus on actually analyzing data and interpreting the meaning of these analyses. Upon completion of the course, students will have attained proficiency in conducting data analysis using techniques commonly encountered in public health research literature.

Course Learning Objectives:

1. Analyze data using the multivariable techniques (i.e. MANOVA, Multiple Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Factor Analysis, and Survival Analysis).

2. Interpret results of data analysis from multivariable techniques (i.e. MANOVA, Multiple Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Factor Analysis, and Survival Analysis, Time-Series Analysis, Path Analysis, and Structural Equation Modeling).

3. Write a statistical analysis plan for a public health data set.

4. Implement a statistical analysis plan for a public health data set.

5. Create reports of the results of a statistical analysis plan.
